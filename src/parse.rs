//! IP:port scanning. The one home for extracting proxy addresses from text.
//!
//! Rust's `regex` crate refuses `IPPortPatternGlobal` — it uses lookahead, and the crate
//! rejects look-around by design (finite automaton → linear-time guarantee). That is a
//! feature, not a limitation: `fancy-regex` would restore lookahead at the cost of the
//! ReDoS risk `utils.py`'s own comments boast of avoiding.
//!
//! So this is a two-pass scanner. Pass 1 uses the `regex` crate with proxybroker2's
//! **exact** IPv4 octet sub-pattern (which has no lookaround), so IP matching — including
//! its leading-zero quirk, `010.1.1.1` and `300.1.2.3 → 00.1.2.3` — is byte-identical.
//! Pass 2 does the IP↔port pairing in code. Verified against a characterization oracle in
//! `tests/ip_scan.rs`.
