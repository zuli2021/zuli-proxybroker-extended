# A `FROM scratch` image: the entire crate — the geo database (include_bytes!) and providers.yaml
# (include_str!) — is embedded, and TLS is ring-only rustls, so the static musl binary has zero
# runtime file or libc dependencies. The final image is just that binary plus the licences.

# Stage 1 — build the fully static binary. rust:alpine targets musl natively, so a plain release
# build is already static; build-base supplies the C toolchain ring needs.
